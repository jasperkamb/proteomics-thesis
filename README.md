# Evaluating Aβ12-28P as a Therapeutic Strategy in an ApoE4 Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease
This project explored how Aβ12-28P treatment affects proteomic, behavioral, and electrophysiological outcomes in SWDI/APOE4 mice to identify multi-level therapeutic effects.

## Data & Methods
- Laser-captured hippocampal CA1 tissue analyzed by LC-MS/MS proteomics  
- Protein normalization, logFC computation, and differential analysis in R  
- Functional enrichment across GO, KEGG, Reactome, and DisGeNET databases  
- Cell-type enrichment and pathway scoring performed using GSVA and ssGSEA  
- STRING and Cytoscape used for protein interaction and network visualization  

## Key Findings
Aβ12-28P treatment enhanced synaptic and metabolic pathways while reducing inflammatory signatures, suggesting broad therapeutic potential for counteracting Alzheimer’s-related pathology.

## Tools & Skills
R, BioConductor, STRING-db, Cytoscape, GSVA, ssGSEA, GO/KEGG/Reactome, DisGeNET, ggplot2
